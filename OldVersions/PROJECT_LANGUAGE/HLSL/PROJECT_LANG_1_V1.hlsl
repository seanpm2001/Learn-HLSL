// Project language file 1
// For: seanpm2001/Learn-HLSL
// About:
// I decided to make HLSL the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-HLSL) as HLSL is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the HLSL programming language. It only makes sense to HLSL the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
